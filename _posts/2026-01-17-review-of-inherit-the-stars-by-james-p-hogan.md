Spoiler Free:

The characters are really an afterthought, this book is really a thought experiemnt regarding what would probably happen within the scientific community if an ancient body was found on the moon. 

The debates, the evidence, and the series of breakthroughs are very good and very enticing. It's fun watching everyone debate their points with vigor and the interpersonal relationships between the team. There's a very poignant example where a character whom our main character loathes and always trades barbs with gets very excited when he realizes that his theory was wrong and actively starts working together with the other team members. It leads to a very fresh, collaborative feeling during the team discussion and it's easy to find yourself getting swept up in the furor and excitement of the debates.

The "twist" is definitely guessable based on the premises presented and a little knowldege of classic sci-fi tropes, but even if you guess it immediately, it does not ruin the book. This is really an instance where it's the journey that matters and there's a secondary mystery that doesn't get answered neatly, but there's enough evidence for you to make some educated guesses about that. 

The ending is also very good. It's very cinematic and the second you read the first sentence you're going to know exactly where it's going and you're going to be very happy it went there. 

It's a very good book that is absolutely worth reading.
